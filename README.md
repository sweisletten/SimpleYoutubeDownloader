#SimpleYoutubeDownloader

  Hello, I am a beginner programmer and Python is my first language. Any comments or advice would gladly be accepted.

  For this project I wanted to make a simple function to download any youtube video on the internet. 
  To acheive this I used the Pytube module which must be downloaded in your environment using 'pip install pytube'.
  Then using Pytube's Youtube object I created a function to retrieve video information and download it to a specified location.

  I plan to use this function to possible make a more complex program.

#How to use this function

  To use this function run 'main.py' and it should ask for the full file path of where you want to save the video.
  Next you can paste the full URL link of the Youtube video you want to download.
  If successful a message saying 'Successful download' will appear.

  Make sure to have Pytube installed in your environment.
